Users can also view the timelines of multiple social networks as one timeline. They can also search for users and hashtags on multiple social networks. Currently, Twitter and Instagram are supported. The app is published on name of my fatherâ€™s company, but as you can see at the copyright notice at the iOS App Store, it is developed by me."

With the app, you can perform calculations that are common in his field of expertise. Those calculations rely on multiple variables, that are automatically saved and loaded into each calculation. An example of this is calculating the needed size of the ducts, based on a given air volume and the speed of the air inside the duct."
